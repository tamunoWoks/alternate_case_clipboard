# Alternate Case Clipboard
Alternate Case Clipboard is a simple Python utility that takes the text currently on your clipboard, converts it to an *alternating uppercase and lowercase pattern*, and then automatically copies the result back to your clipboard, while preserving punctuation, spaces, and numbers.

For example: 
```txt
Input:   Python is awesome!
Output:  pYtHoN iS aWeSoMe!
```
### Features:
- Reads text directly from your clipboard
- Alternates case for letters only
- Keeps punctuation, numbers, and spaces unchanged
- Copies the transformed text back to your clipboard automatically
- Prints the result to your terminal
