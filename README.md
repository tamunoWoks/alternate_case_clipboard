# Alternate Case Clipboard
Alternate Case Clipboard is a simple Python utility that takes the text currently on your clipboard, converts it to an alternating uppercase and lowercase pattern, and then automatically copies the result back to your clipboard, while preserving punctuation, spaces, and numbers.

For example: 
```txt
